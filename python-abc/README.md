## Python - Abstract Classes and Interfaces

----

- Abstract classes in Python are used to enforce an execution structure on   child classes.
- Interfaces are emulated using abstract classes that contain only abstract methods.
- The abc module, along with ABC and @abstractmethod, is used to create this behavior.
- These concepts help build scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems—especially in large projects or multi-developer teams.
